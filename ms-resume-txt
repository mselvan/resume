Summary:
With 15 years of experience in software engineering, I have successfully led many key initiatives through lean operations. Over the past six years, my work in technical product management has involved making complex technical decisions for product teardowns, functional changes, new builds, and rebuilds. I have significantly impacted the businesses I've worked with throughout my career by consistently making informed, strategic decisions. My approach to leadership is collaborative, focusing on guiding teams and creating an environment that supports their ability to deliver outstanding results.

Achievements:
- Scored in the top 1% out of more than 5 million CCAT test participants worldwide, demonstrating solid verbal, mathematical, logical, and spatial reasoning skills.
- Boosted delivery throughput five-fold per quarter by implementing lean assembly lines composed of 2- to 8-hour work units, enabling 24/7 coverage, resulting in >750% operating profits.
- Contributed to CloudFix technical specs, leading to annual internal savings of $3.3M ($4.5M to $1.2M ~ 75%) during the pilot run and over $100M for customers.
- Spearheaded the post-acquisition transformation of Jive Software in 2017, a $462M business acquired by Aurea, managing hand-offs, GDPR, documentation, and product rollouts amidst a substantial attrition rate exceeding 80%.
- Consolidated IT/SaaS Operations across the portfolio in 2016, generating annual cost savings of $4.3M ($5M to $700K ~ 85%), leveraging economies of scale, enhancing efficiency, and optimal resource management.
- Co-founded two startups in 2009 (fintech) and 2013 (e-commerce), garnering valuable insights into startup operations and the broader business and technology landscape.
- Penned technical teardown specs of 3rd party products (e.g., ChatGPT, Twilio, Slack, Loom) as well as in-house products (e.g., WorkSmart, Kayako) and functional specs of new products (e.g., CloudFix, Tempo).
- Authored numerous 5K rewrite specs to rebuild legacy software products in less than 5K LOC using off-the-shelf AWS technologies that originally spanned millions of LOC.
